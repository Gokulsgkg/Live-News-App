Steps:

1.Navigate to your project directory:

Open a terminal window (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your React application code resides.
For example, if your code is in a folder named news-app on your desktop, type:

cd Desktop/news-app

Install dependencies:

Since the node_modules folder is missing, you'll need to reinstall the required
dependencies listed in your package.json file. Run the following command in your terminal:


npm install

This will download and install all the necessary libraries and packages your application needs to run from the npm registry.

Start the development server:

Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the development server:

npm start

This will typically start a development server, usually on port 3000 by default.
You can view your running news application in a web browser by opening
 http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port if different).
